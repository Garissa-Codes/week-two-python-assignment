**## My List Operations Script**

This project demonstrates basic list operations in Python, such as adding, inserting, extending, sorting, and finding elements.

The script is an excellent introduction to Python list manipulation, designed for beginners and those interested in learning fundamental Python programming.

## **📜Features**

**The list is created in the following steps:**

Creating an empty list: Starts with an empty list.

Appending elements: Adds numbers 10, 20, 30, 40 to the list.

Inserting an element: Inserts the value 15 at the second position in the list.

Extending the list: Adds another list [50, 60, 70] to the original list.

Removing the last element: Deletes the last element from the list.

Sorting the list: Orders the elements in ascending order.

Finding the index of a value: Locates the position of 30 in the sorted list.
